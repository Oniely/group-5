Formulas:

Attack -> the players ATK is rolled on a multiplicative dice roll with the range of 1 to 6. This gives us a possible multiplier of 10% to 60% extra damage. The final damage is then calculated by adding the player's base ATK to the damage from the dice roll, multiplied by the multiplier. (Player Base Damage + (dice roll * 0.1))

Defense -> the players DEF is used as a baseline for a percentage to negate the damage taken. A defense of 4 means 40% damage negation. The damage taken is calculated as: (DamageTaken - (DamageTaken * DEF))
